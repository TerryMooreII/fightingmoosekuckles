## Big Blind
Before every game a person will be designated to bring 24 ice cold beers.

## Small Blind
The person who takes the first penelty from the previous game will be required to bring 12 ice cold beers.

If no penalty is taken, the goalie is responsible for the small blind

In the very rare circumstance that we have no penelties and a shut out, the goalie is allowed to designate any person to bring the next games small blind
